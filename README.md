## Overview
This repository contains a solution to the classic Reader-Writer problem in computer science, implemented in C. The Reader-Writer problem deals with scenarios where a shared resource must be accessed by multiple readers and writers concurrently.

## Files
- `noStarw.c`: Implementation without starvation.
- `readStarw.c`: Reader starvation.
- `writStarw.c`: Writer starvation.
- `Makefile`: For compiling the project.

## Usage
